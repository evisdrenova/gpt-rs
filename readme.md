# Introduction

GPT-rs is an open source 100% Rust implementation of GPT-2. This implementation is based on Sebastian Raschka's 'Build a Large Langauge Model From Scratch' book.

The book walks through building GPT-2 from scratch in Python.

I don't love Python so I thought it would be fun to do it in Rust instead.

As I'm going through this implementation, I'm also writing down thoughts and notes in a blog style file called `blog.md`.
