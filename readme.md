# Introduction

\*\* !REPO is a Work-in-Progress! &&

GPT-RS aims to be a llama.cpp equivalent in rust with better developer ergonomics and portability.

I'm (@evisdrenova) actively working on this project and if you're interested in contributing code/design/thoughts, please open an issue,

## Motivation

1. I don't like python
2. I don't like C++
3. I like rust
4. I believe in local-first AI and want to build the underlying platform that powers it as the models get better, faster and smaller
